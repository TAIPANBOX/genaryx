# Enforces invariant 21 of CLAUDE.md: no tracked file quotes the owner or
# attributes a decision to him by name.
#
# WHY
#
# This repository is public. A decision the owner made is still recorded,
# because a later reader has to know it is a decision and not something to
# re-derive: it is written as `@decided YYYY-MM-DD` followed by a paraphrase in
# this repository's own words, and never edited afterwards. What is not written
# is his own wording, or his name as the one who said, asked or decided
# something. Until 2026-10-08 eight markers carrying his first name, 71 lines
# naming him, and about 97 lines of Ukrainian prose (most of it his words or
# notes written for him) sat in tracked files, and nothing would have stopped
# the next one.
#
# FOUR SHAPES ARE REFUSED, each on the line it occurs on:
#
#   1. the old provenance marker, an at-sign followed by his first name, in
#      any case;
#   2. a guillemet on a line that also carries Cyrillic, the shape his quotes
#      took;
#   3. Cyrillic in prose: anywhere in a non-code file, and outside a string
#      literal in a code file (.rs .ts .tsx .js .mjs .cjs). A string literal may
#      carry Cyrillic, because hostile-input tests need non-Latin text; so may
#      a file under a testdata/ directory;
#   4. his first name capitalised as a word, outside an authorship line (one
#      that says copyright, author or maintainer): the shape of "he found",
#      "his call", "he read the demo", which a list of verbs would never
#      finish. The owner as copyright holder or author is not a quote and
#      passes.
#
# URLs are blanked before 1, 2 and 4 run: the name inside somebody's address
# is an address, not an attribution.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH
#
# An English quote of his words in ordinary quotation marks, an attribution
# that does not use his name ("the owner said"), and a paraphrase that is in
# fact a translation: those are prose a reader judges, and nothing mechanical
# can. In a code file a line that opens as a comment is prose whole; on a
# line that opens as code, a string literal is found per line, so a quoted
# Ukrainian phrase in a comment trailing code on the same line passes, and
# Cyrillic in a string spanning several lines is refused, the safe way to be
# wrong. It reads only what git tracks.
#
# The rule is the estate's (costcrew's `TestNoTrackedFileQuotesOrAttributesTheOwner`
# and stack-k8s's `scripts/no-owner-quotes.sh` hold the same four shapes).
